    <div class="project">
        <h3>iBrand</h3>
        <p>
            iBrand is a smart content generation platform that helps brands and social media marketers catch trends early and generate catchy, engaging posts in their own brand voice. 
            It does this by scraping trending news, enriching the data, and streaming it through a big data pipeline where personalized social media content is generated using AI and NLP.

        <h3>Credit Card Fraud Detection</h3>
        <p>
            Our team built a fraud detection system that can analyze millions of credit card transactions and identify suspicious activity in real time. 
            We used advanced machine learning models to recognize patterns of fraudulent behavior and compared them with normal transactions. 
            The project included a simple dashboard where users can upload transactions or enter details to instantly check if a transaction is likely to be fraud. 
            This demonstrates how big data and AI can protect customers and financial institutions from fraud.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Heart Disease Detection using Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            We made a system that predicts whether a person may have heart disease by analyzing health information such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and exercise data. 
            Using real patient datasets, we trained and compared different machine learning models to see which could provide the most accurate results. 
            Our best models reached close to 90% accuracy, showing how AI can support doctors in identifying risks early and improving patient care.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>Real-Time Traffic Analysis (RTTA)</h3>
        <p>
            RTTA focuses on analyzing traffic patterns, especially for emergency vehicles, to optimize routes in real time. 
            Using Ontario 511, Google Maps Traffic API, and other open data sources, the project builds a data pipeline to monitor and predict traffic congestion, helping prioritize critical traffic.

    <div class="project">
        <h3>AI in Predictive Toxicology (AIPT)</h3>
        <p>
            AIPT uses AI tools to predict drug toxicity early in the drug development process. 
            Machine learning models analyze chemical structures and predict adverse drug reactions, helping researchers identify risky compounds before clinical trials.
            Data sources include PubChem and Tox21, and the project leverages cloud platforms for scalable analysis.
